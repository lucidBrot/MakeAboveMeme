Description: **MakeAboveMeme**
        A command-line tool to create a meme with an image and some text above. Above that a title, below that some tags, and below them a line with "x comments, y points". Everything is optional but it looks ugly without the image.  
        Here's an example made with version 0.2
        
        ``python makeAboveMeme.py -T "Thest of the Mhemery" -i "https://i.imgur.com/Y3w71er.jpg" --tag "global warming" --tag "earth chan" --tag "tags are traps" --tag "What the fuck" -c "other" -p 3

        **Installation and Dependencies**
        Maybe `pip install MakeAboveMeme` works. If not, make sure the following dependencies are installed and perform `git clone https://github.com/lucidBrot/MakeAboveMeme.git ./MakeAboveMeme`.
        
        * `sudo apt-get install xvfb` or your standard x-server running
        * [webkit2png](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48537053/2550406)
        
        **Execute**
        `python makeAboveMeme.py -T "test title"`
        `webkit2png temp.html -o meme.png -x 700 1000`
        
        **Error Codes**
        If everything goes fine, the default should be 0.
        If something breaks unexpectedly, the default should be 1.
        If the call to webkit2png breaks, the exit code is 2.
        
        **Formatting**
        Any html tags are sanitized away. You can use `\n` typed out, the newline character `\n`, or `<br>` for line breaks though.
